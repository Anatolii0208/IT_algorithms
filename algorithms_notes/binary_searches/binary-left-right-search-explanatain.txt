Left binary search:
Let's imagine that we've got not correct element then we need to move left board. And we wiil move it to middle + 1 because we know that middle element is not correct so we can slice him too.
If our element is correct we don't know is this element is an answer or another so we will move right board to midlle element.
Right binary search :
We do the same but if we have incorrect element we need to move right board and all correct elements are on the left side so we need to equel right board = middle  - 1 element
